## This is an English to Fench (primitive) neural machine translation project with deployment using Gradio
Explanation : A seq-to-seq model is a type of neural network architecture that is used for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. It consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes in a sequence of input data and processes it into a fixed-length vector representation, which is then passed to the decoder. The decoder takes this vector and generates a sequence of output data.
